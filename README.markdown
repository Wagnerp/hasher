Hasher Utility
==============

Simple command line tool to hash a string or a file using MD5, SHA1, SHA256 or SHA512.

Once built execute the tool on the command line by calling "hasher" and you will see the help showing how to use it.

TODO: 
- Seperating out the code into a library, but still want to have a stand alone command line file to chuck into system32 folder :)
- Creating unit tests in xUnit for the library.
