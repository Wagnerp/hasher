Hasher Utility
==============

A simple hashing tool. There is a command line and a GUI program that can hash file content or text using several different hashing algorithms. I made this because OpenSSL, which I normal use for this task, didn't have SHA512 support. There is also a library (dll/assembly) that can be used in other projects. The library allows registering other Hashing algorithms.
