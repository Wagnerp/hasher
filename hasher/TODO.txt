- Work things so that this exe can be used as a library
- Consider removing the "file:" argument and just checking whether the text given is a valid filename???
  Will need to notify the user that the thing hashed was a file or just plain text as the argument though!!!
- look at changing things so that filename is default and text needs to be inputed using /t: ""
- CreateFileStreamIfAvailable() is dodgie. Make a test function to
  see if the file given is valid and exists and then work from
  the main function based on that. Getting the file contents should be a 
  few lines of code and should dispose in place, not later and somewhere else!
- Allow registering of HashAlgorithms (does this make sense?)
